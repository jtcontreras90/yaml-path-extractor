## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `yamlPathExtractor.pathSeparator`: String used to separate the path parts. For example, 'path **.** to **.** your **.** key' Default is '.' (dot)
* `yamlPathExtractor.ignoreFilenameRoot`: Ignore the root key if it matches the file name. This is usefull for I18n on Ruby on Rails. Default is `true`
* `yamlPathExtractor.includeFilename`: Include the yaml file's name as first step in the path.
Default is `false`
